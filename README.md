## Taylor Johnston
Hi, I'm Taylor â€“ a journalist with the focus of telling impactful stories at the intersection of __data__ and __design__. 

Currently, I'm a data fellow at [The Center for Public Integrity](https://publicintegrity.org/) where I utilize data, technology and design, while being trained alongside the data
team, to produce investigative journalism on issues of public concern.

I currently reside in Cleveland, OH and graduated from Ohio University in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Journalism and Interactive Information Design. When I'm not creating a data visualization or sifting through a spreadsheet, I enjoy reading, discovering new music on Spotify, practicing my calligraphy or walking my dog, Burke.
